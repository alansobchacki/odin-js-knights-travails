Project: Knights Travails
=============

An algorithm that outputs the shortest path a Knight can take from one square to another in a Chessboard.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-knights-travails)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the eleventh project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [11/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Build a function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.


What I Learned
-----

The hardest project I've come across The Odin Project, so far. While I was familiar with Breadth First Search algorithms, learning about graphs, vertices, and edges was interesting. The concepts weren't hard, but translating them into code was rough.

Notes
-----
If you visit the website, you'll see that nothing is displayed. This is intended behavior. The project only required a working algorithm. 

You can open the console window to see it in action. The function knightTravails() is called with the parameters of ([0, 0], [3, 3]).

It correctly outputs the smallest path possible ([0,0] -> [2,1] -> [3,3]) and how many steps were required (2). 

My main goal was to build a working algorithm. Allowing users to tweak the parameters or implementing visuals wasn't a requirement. It does feel like a waste not to implement these, and it certainly wouldn't take that long, but I have more shiny toys to build right now.
